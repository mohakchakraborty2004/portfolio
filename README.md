# 2D Metaverse-Style Portfolio  

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my **2D Metaverse-Style Portfolio**, where I turned the usual boring portfolio idea into something fun and interactive. Instead of just reading about me, you can now *walk* through my virtual workspace, explore stuff, and pretend you're in my room! ðŸ˜Ž  

---

## Whatâ€™s Inside?  

- A **2D virtual space** that looks like my workspace (well, kinda ðŸ˜·).  
- A **little character** you can control. Yes, youâ€™re the boss here.  
- Interactive objects like a bed, almirah, and a computer (okay, not super interactive, but itâ€™s a start!).  
- Built using **React** and **Phaser.js** because why not?  

---

## Letâ€™s Be Honest  

This project is still a bit *janky*. Hereâ€™s what I mean:  
- The map centering is kinda meh.  
- The graphics are basic (but they have character, right?).  
- Itâ€™s still a work in progress, so donâ€™t expect Hogwarts-level magic here.
- I had to design my character and map on my own.  

But hey, itâ€™s functional, and I had fun making it!

## Controls  
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the little dude around.  
- **Space (eventually)**: Interact with stuff (still working on that...).  

---

## Known Weirdness  
- The map might not center properly, but hey, itâ€™s an artistic choice (not really).  
- Collision is a bit funky. Try not to walk into walls too much.  
- Graphics are simple because Iâ€™m no pixel art wizard.

## Why Did I Do This?  

Because plain portfolios are *boring*. And also, because I wanted to mess around with Phaser.js and React.

## Wanna Help?  

Found a bug? Got a cool idea? Want to add a coffee machine to my virtual room? Fork the repo and send me a PR. Iâ€™m open to all the help I can get!

## Shoutout  

Big thanks to all the open-source tools and the Phaser community for helping me not lose my mind while figuring this out.

So, go ahead, explore my room, and have fun! If you get lost, although its not a big one, donâ€™t blame me. ðŸ˜…
